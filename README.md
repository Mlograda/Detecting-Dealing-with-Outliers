# Detecting-Dealing-with-Outliers

In this repository, there's a code I use to detect and deal with outliers in a dataset.

'Detecting outliers.ipyng' present techniques to detect univariate outliers, bivariate outliers, and multivariate outliers.

'Dealing with outliers.ipyng' Notebook demonstrates methods to deal with outliers based on the analytica goal of the project and the analytic tools to be used. 

  * The first example in the notebook shows how to deal with outliers when the analytic goal is to find a relationship between weight as a dependent variable and height and gender as independent variable. The analytic toold used are linear regression (LR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP).

  * The second example shows how to deal with outliers when the analytic goal is to group population communities into five groups and assigning the appropriate liaisons officer based on the characteristics of clustered groups. The analytic tool used is K-Means clustering.
